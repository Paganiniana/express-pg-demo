# Node / TS Boilerplate

This is a public boilerplate repository for a simple combination I use every day: TypeScript and Express. It makes use of the following packages:

- [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)
- [express](https://expressjs.com/)

To get started, run the following:

```bash
npm install
```
